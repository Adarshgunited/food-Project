In this corrected code:

I replaced useRouteError with useNavigate, which is the correct hook to use for navigation in React Router.

I added a button with an onClick handler to navigate back to the home page (/). You can customize this button and its functionality based on your application requirements.

Feel free to uncomment and use the status and statusText attributes from the error object if you want to display more detailed error information.
